Set of related programs that provides package managing<br/>
Written in Pure Bash for HarDClanZ Linux Distribution

## Come closer
**hpkg** - dumb script that *only unpacks* hard packages. Calls his grown brother **hardman** for resolving dependeces<br/>
**hardman** - **hpkg**'s big brother. Removes installed packages, manages conflicts, resolving dependeces<br/>
**makehard** - tool for creating packages. FUBAR<br/>
**hcfg** - manages config<br/>
<br/>
**hparts** - divine tool that give advantage over ***all other*** PacMans. Provides ability to **hotplug patching**. (Developing right now) <br/>
## Roadmap
```
control/ -- hardman and others
hpkg/ -- hpkg itself
packing/ -- stuff for creating packages
```
## TODO
1. Bring makehard in usable condition
2. Complete hparts
