In nearly future `hpkg-ref.sh' will be removed

hpkg-ref.sh originally was created for managing archives and not software pkgs
it contains alot of legacy unmaintained code

hpkg-ref.sh will be splitted in 3 seperate programs:

* hpkg-explode
* hpkg-exec
* hpkg

hpkg-explode will extract .hard package. Usable for maintain purposes. Replaces legacy `container' mode
hpkg-exec will act as now `executable' mode. It will be used as `flatpack' or `AppImage' to test some application before install
hpkg will install packages

Concepts of hpkg will not change but details will:
hpkg will be rewritten in clearer bash, `sed', `cut' etc will be replaced with internal bash substitution
hpkg database will be reformed from deb-control-like syntax to shell syntax, this will ease `hardman' and `libhpkgcb' (via libshcfg) integration

Also, `hpart' - going to be modernized and brought to suitable condition
